    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A dog that eats well and sleeps well, of course.</p>

<p>And with a good owner hopefully, who&rsquo;ll walk me around on sunny weekends and buy me expensive toys.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget nice fur and strong muscles - these are a must for successful relationships.</p>

<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t ever envy humans - they are smart, interesting and can do whatever they want, but, there surely is no reason to want to become a human.</p>

<p>&hellip;or is there?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that every time I pay such thoughts a visit it ends up in a circle, where the thing I wish to become would somehow take a shape that wishes back to become what I am right now.</p>

<p>It seems that the frustration is not in trying to <em>be something</em>, but really in trying to <em>be more than something</em>.</p>

<p>That means a good dog should never try to be more than a dog.</p>

<p><em>And a good human should never wish to be a dog.</em></p>
