Here's a list of on-going projects that I've had the time and interest to invest myself in:

1. **[VIMonad](https://github.com/lynnard/VIMonad)**: the XMonad configs and modules that realize some of my craziest thoughts on window management
2. **[FMC/FMD](https://github.com/lynnard/fmd)**: a command-line music streaming player built on top of services from *Douban.fm* and *Jing.fm*
3. **[LN2D](https://github.com/lynnard/LN2D)**: a gaming library for *Cocos2d*
4. **[Lynnard](/projects/lynnard)**: a chatter-bot with a Wechat account
