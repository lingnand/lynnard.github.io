I've recently got the time to spice up my XMonad configuration even further - really taking the time to think about the design, and implementing the features which I think ultimately make a great window manager.

To summarise (in the simplest sense) what my XMonad can do right now:

* use motion keys. `w` to move one window forward; `b` to go back; `f<symbol>`
