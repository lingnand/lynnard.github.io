## Work in tabs

Open multiple files at once and easily switch between them. Or open the same file in different tabs and refer to its different parts.

## Syntax highlight based on filetype

Helium supports syntax highlight in real time for over 50 filetypes: *ada, applescript, asm, awk, bat, bib, bison, c, caml, changelog, clipper, cobol, coffeescript, conf, cpp, csharp, css, d, desktop, diff, erlang, flex, fortran, glsl, haskell, haskell_literate, haxe, html, java, javascript, latex, ldap, lilypond, lisp, log, logtalk, lua, m4, makefile, manifest, pascal, perl, php, postscript, prolog, python, ruby, scala, scheme, sh, slang, sml, sql, tcl, texinfo, vbscript, xml*

## Mod-key shortcuts while editing

Miss `Ctrl-S` for saving a file quickly on your PC? Well, in Helium, you can do that by pressing `Enter-S` (hit `S` while holding `Enter`). Likewise, `Enter+T` lets you insert a tab, whereas `Enter+D` deletes the current line. Almost everything in Helium has a keyboard shortcut, and most of them can be used as key-chords when you are busily typing away in the editor.

## Undo and redo

...So no more worrying about losing changes.

## Regex find and replace

Full Perl-style regular expressions in find. Capturing groups in replace. Hooray.

## Executing scripts or previewing html

Run python and shell scripts directly from the editor, or preview html and javascript in a web page. Best of all, Helium knows which of these to run based on filetypes, so all you have to do is pressing a button.

## 4 colorschemes and 20+ fonts

Helium includes popular colorschemes such as *summerfruit* and *Tomorrow*. It also ships with some of the best fonts, such as *Dejavu Mono* and *Times New Roman*.

## Zero interruption

Never wait for a file to be saved into your Dropbox again. Helium is good at multithreading - that means saving files in background, highlighting each document in a different routine, and not getting into your way so that you can keep on with your work for as long as possible.
